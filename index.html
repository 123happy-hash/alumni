            <p class="text-muted text-left">It was common knowledge that admitting to any sort of depression was a good way to get yourself kicked out of school. My freshman year, some naive fellow frosh went to Student Health, saying he was stressed from the workload and wondered if they had any study skills classes. They badgered him about whether he was suicidal, and (admittedly by the guy's own account), he said something sarcastic along the lines of "clearly I'm suicidal, that's why I'm interested in better study skills". The cops were called, and he ended up on an involuntary psych hold and was legally barred from campus. Six months later, the restraining order still in place, he wrote an editorial for the campus paper complaining about his treatment. Don't know what happened to the kid after that.</p>

            <h4>Building equity into vaccine distribution</h4>
            <img src="MIT-Vaccine-Distribution-01_0.gif" class="img-responsive col-lg-5 col-md-5 col-sm-5 col-xs-12">
            <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">As the U.S. speeds up distribution of Covid-19 vaccines, the question of equity keeps surfacing. Who gets priority? If the pandemic is hitting certain communities harder, can they be adequately supplied with vaccine doses? What’s the best way to balance the needs of different groups within society?

MIT economist Parag Pathak’s work emphasizes those questions — and helps tackle them. Over the last year, Pathak and a group of colleagues have developed an approach to the distribution of vaccines and other medical goods that is being used in Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Tennessee.

This approach, called either a “reserve system” or a “categorized priority system,” allows medical resources to be allocated among multiple groups at once, while retaining enough flexibility to help groups with especially acute needs. In practice, a vaccine can be distributed among frontline medical workers and senior citizens while also reaching places that have been especially hard-hit by Covid-19.

“The reserve system offers a way to get to some compromise, where you still respect the prioritization of frontline workers and the elderly, but you also have a way to scale up to how you want to protect the most disadvantaged communities,” says Pathak, the Class of 1922 Professor of Economics.

That need certainly exists: Geographically, the pandemic has taken a heavy toll in many hotspot areas across the country. Demographically, as a Jan. 26 CNN analysis of 14 states showed, about 4 percent of the white Americans have been vaccinated so far, compared to just 1.9 percent of Blacks and 1.8 percent of Hispanics.</p>

            <h4>Epigenomic map reveals circuitry of 30,000 human disease regions</h4>
                <img src="MIT-Noncoding-Genome-01-press_0.jpg" class="img-responsive col-lg-5 col-md-5 col-sm-5 col-xs-12">
                <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">Twenty years ago this month, the first draft of the human genome was publicly released. One of the major surprises that came from that project was the revelation that only 1.5 percent of the human genome consists of protein-coding genes.

Over the past two decades, it has become apparent that those noncoding stretches of DNA, originally thought to be “junk DNA,” play critical roles in development and gene regulation. In a new study published today, a team of researchers from MIT has published the most comprehensive map yet of this noncoding DNA.

This map provides in-depth annotation of epigenomic marks — modifications indicating which genes are turned on or off in different types of cells — across 833 tissues and cell types, a significant increase over what has been covered before. The researchers also identified groups of regulatory elements that control specific biological programs, and they uncovered candidate mechanisms of action for about 30,000 genetic variants linked to 540 specific traits.

“What we’re delivering is really the circuitry of the human genome. Twenty years later, we not only have the genes, we not only have the noncoding annotations, but we have the modules, the upstream regulators, the downstream targets, the disease variants, and the interpretation of these disease variants,” says Manolis Kellis, a professor of computer science, a member of MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory and of the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, and the senior author of the new study.

MIT graduate student Carles Boix is the lead author of the paper, which appears today in Nature. Other authors of the paper are MIT graduate students Benjamin James and former MIT postdocs Yongjin Park and Wouter Meuleman, who are now principal investigators at the University of British Columbia and the Altius Institute for Biomedical Sciences, respectively. The researchers have made all of their data publicly available for the broader scientific community to use.</p>
